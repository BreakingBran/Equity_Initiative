# Equity_Initiative
Equithon 2018 project for equality

  The Equity_Initiative project is a web application on which users can sign up and share their stories about overcoming obstacles and communicate with those who comment on their bio or their posts.
  
  Inspire is the name of the site which is a good indicator of the website's function: to inspire and assist those going through challenging times or those who need inspiration. In our day to day lives, it is rare to encounter someone who has gone through a challenging situation you may be going through who has achieved their own idea of success. It also may be hard to hear about how this role model's got support and used different strategies to achieve success. Inspire allows people to easily search for other users or posts that belong to the category that interests them. They can then make contact with those who can relate and give sound advice, in their own time. To know you're not alone and how to access resources such as these role models will help people through the difficulties they face in day to day life without the need to approach others in public which may be unnerving.
  
  With this in mind, we hope to empower users and to create a community where people can help each other. Some next steps would be allowing admin to take down mallicious posts, users to have control over comments and replies on their own page, creating smaller groups within the web community and granting users the ability to report inappropriate content.
  
  Even further development could include private messaging, sharing of multi-media and using machine learning to have posts in searches relate on a more personal level to the users.
